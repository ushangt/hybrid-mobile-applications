Trying OnSenUI

https://onsen.io/

**Pros:**

1. Well documented.

2. Awesome clean UI.

3. iOS looks like native.

4. Theme Roller makes things easy.

**Cons:**

1. Doesn't look native on android devices.

2. Conflicts a lot with jQuery.

3. Sluggish performance on Android.

4. Has its own tags. Accessing them through other javascript libraries is a pain.

5. Not much community/stackoverflow support.

**Final Verdict:**

1. Use if you want native iOS experience through hybrid.

2. Will improve with time I feel.
